# EMG_Decomposition
EMG decomposition of a signal containing motor unit action potentials (MUAPs)
using template matching

Just Clone and run the .py

# Output
  - Templates of MUAPs
  - A sample of the data with a marker indicating MUAP generation and Template type
  - Frequency spectrum of secondary signals, where these secondary signals are 1 if MUAP peak is there
